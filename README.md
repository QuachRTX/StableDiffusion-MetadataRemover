# StableDiffusion-MetadataRemover


## Description
"StableDiffusion-MetadataRemover" is a straightforward and effective tool for removing metadata from images generated by Stable Diffusion. This Python script simplifies the process of stripping away information, such as prompts, which are stored in the images' metadata. It's ideal for artists and creators who wish to share their work without revealing the prompts used.

## How It Works
The script utilizes the PIL (Python Imaging Library) to open and save images, automatically removing metadata in the process. The program can be operated via command line or through a drag-and-drop interface, making it accessible for users with varying levels of programming experience.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PIL (Pillow)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuachRTX/StableDiffusion-MetadataRemover.git
```

2. Install PIL (Pillow), if not already installed:
```bash
pip install Pillow
```
## Optional Executable
For ease of use, an executable version of the script is available. This allows users to remove metadata from images simply by dragging and dropping them onto the .exe file. This method does not require any command line interaction and is user-friendly for those unfamiliar with Python or command line usage.
